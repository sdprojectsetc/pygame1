Current game: a simple video game with 2 components:
  1. a user-controlled character that can move left-right and up-down (with gravity in effect)
  2. stationary platforms that the player is able to land on (note: the player should not be able to pass through the platforms, this is a bug in the code I am actively fixing)

Goal: some sort of level-based game? I was toying with the idea of having a desk-theme, with the object of the level to position the plant in a specific spot on the desk
